<p>You helped my fracture go from fractured to fabulous! I fractured my toe this July... I am a competitive Irish Dancer and cannot dance with a fracture! I went to Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care on Broadway, and was put in a boot for 6 weeks, the healing went awesome and I was out of the boot in no time! I still had pain when I danced and so Dr. Strash sent us to PT. The PT physicians were awesome, he picked the right people for me! We had a blast! I easily recovered and now am back dancing!But, just last week at dance class I had pain in my heel. I knew it was Sever's disease and after talking to Dr. Strash... he put me in a night time splint and in spenco heel lifts with sneakers. I don't feel any pain now and it's only been 6 days!! I need more shoes  but can only wear ones that support my arch because I have a high arch. So Dr. Strash gave my mom a prescription for Chacos and Merrels so we have a tax deduction for a good, supportive pair of shoes! Dr. Strash is the reason I can still dance today and this December travel to D.C. for regionals which I would not be able to compete in without the Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care! Being a growing kid, I have lots of problems with my feet, but I now know exactly what to do if I have any pain... Call Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care!! You guys are lifesavers! Thank You sooooooooooooo much!!!</p>
