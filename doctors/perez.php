<p itemprop="review">I just wanted to express my thanks and appreciation for the wonderful treatment and care Dr. Perez showed to me following my recent Bunion surgery.</p> <p>I travel from the Rio Grand Valley to San Antonio for all my Podiatry needs because I heard from a relative that Dr. Perez is the best podiatrist.

I could not thank him enough he has changed my life, no one should have to learn to live with pain and he has taught me that.</p> <p>Dr. Perez demonstrated total commitment into caring for me when I was helpless in the days immediately following the operation and also gave me the support and encouragement I needed to take my first steps on the road to my recovery which meant so much to me.</p>

<p itemprop="review">I would like to give Dr. Perez a thousand thanks for being an excelling doctor and having a beautiful, humane personality. I would highly recommend him to anyone. For 13 years I have had diabetes and I have never known a doctor like him. He is the one who saved my feet. <span itemprop="review">Other doctors have told me my feet cannot be saved, but Dr. Perez did not give up on me. He knows what he is doing, he is fast, but more importantly, he treats you like a person. I give thanks to God for putting him in my life and for helping so many people with foot problems.</p>
