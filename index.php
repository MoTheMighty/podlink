          <h2>Results</h2>
          
        <p>We consistently have satisfied patients and in our most recent patient survey 91% of our patients 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' with the statement, 'I was satisfied with my medical care'.  Our practice routinely receives comments stating, ”was offered treatment that was better than I was offered in another office", “doctor explained my condition, outlined my recovery and explained the expected results and possible future needs" and “Doctor was very knowledgeable and patient. He gave me a thorough explanation about my problem in a way that was easy to understand".<p>

  <blockquote>[I liked] how the doctor listened, didn't seem rushed to get me out quickly. He took the time to sit down 
  and seemed genuinely concerned, good eye contact and bedside manner. He offered the most thorough treatment. Did not just 
  walk in and prescribe meds and leave. They had equipment on site to make accurate diagnosis and did not have to travel 
  for x-rays and then back - which delays treatment.<float-right><small>Patient of Alamo Family Foot & Ankle Care</small></float-right></blockquote>
