 <h1>Eight tips for new runners</h1>

          <p>I have the good fortune of seeing many runners in my practice.  Typically, around marathon season, there will be a  steady stream of runners coming to see me with various injuries ranging from tendonitis to stress fractures.</p>  <p>Until recently, I could not directly relate to runners; I was not one of them.</p>
            <p>Cycling has been my passion for the last ten years.  In 2005 I weighed 50 lbs more than I do now - I needed to take action.  After watching the Tour de France that year, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an indoor bike.
            About three weeks of boredom led me to abandon the machine and soon it became a fixture for hanging clothes and various odds and ends.  I graduated to a true road bike and discovered my passion. Biking.
            Fast forward to the winter of 2014-15.  It has been cold and wet here in San Antonio.   I have an indoor trainer for my bike, but I decided that unlike years past, I would forgo the tedium of that activity.</p>
            <h3>Running.</h3>
            <img src="../../../blog/images/perezjog.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="Dr. Richard Perez">
            <p>Running was going to be my go to aerobic sport for this winter.  Mind you, I have never run before, but I was determined to not regain the 50 lbs that I had fought so hard to lose.</p>
            <p>Six weeks into the hobby, I must say I have a new appreciation for the various ailments I have treated for runners throughout the years.  My shins hurt, hips ache, forefoot burns, peroneal tendons pull and my Achilles tendons pulsate.
            But slowly, my body is becoming accustomed to the new movements.  The pains subside and the benefits realized.
            From my brief time running here are 8 things I’ve learned.</p>
            <ul>
            <img src="../../../blog/images/perezshoes.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="newton running shoes">
              <li>Get a good pair of running shoes from a reputable running store.  Ask the sales person to watch you run on their in store treadmill.  For me- the recommendation was an entry level <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-aha-gateway-trainer">Newtons</a>.  So far so good.  I like the way the shoe feels.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nyrr.org/youth-and-schools/running-start/coaching-videos/high-school/form/form-101-running-posture">Good posture.</a>  Slouching is a killer on your back.  Focus on a straight back and deliberate strides.  Knees up.  </li>

              <li><a href="http://www.active.com/running/articles/the-importance-of-rest-for-runners">Rest.</a></li>
              <li>See previous.</li>
              <li>For me, I found that <a href="http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/run-walk/">running one mile followed by walking one minute</a> allows some of the lactic acid to clear my legs and makes the run more comfortable.</li>
              <li>Don’t over do it at first.  Remember to let your body rest.</li>
              <li>Vary you pace from run to run.</li>
              <li>Have fun.</li>

      <p>Dr. Comfort, a leading manufacturer of therapeutic footwear, has released the <a href="http://homecaremag.com/news/unique-study-reveals-clinical-impacts-therapeutic-footwear-people-type-2-diabetes">results of its recent study</a>, which examined the clinical impact of therapeutic footwear on diabetic complications, including foot ulcers and amputations, in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The retrospective claims database study reviewed patients during a three-year period and showed that the likelihood of foot ulcers and amputation in T2DM patients not wearing therapeutic footwear was higher than in patients who did wear therapeutic footwear.  The study revealed that foot ulceration decreased by 2 percent and 12 percent in years one and two respectively, while lower limb amputation decreased by 29 percent and 18 percent in years one and two respectively.</p>

      <p>I often hear words similar to this from many of my patients who seek podiatric care for their toe nail problems.  More often then not, the problem can be blamed on fungus.  Toenail fungus is a very common problem seen by podiatrist.  It is often ignored, starting out as a small discoloration on the tip of the nail.  But with time, that small area grows and grows.  And before you know it....

      <p>Severe bunion deformities often cause quite a bit of physical pain.  Shoe gear, especially, dress shoes can be quite bothersome.  Physical activities can also make the bunion hurt.  But beyond the physical pain, there can also be an emotional toll.</p>

          <p>"You have an athlete’s foot infection" I said.</p>
          <p>Upon presenting the case to my attending, I was confident in my diagnosis.  It was a clear-cut, easy dermatology problem.  Well not so fast.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p itemprop="associatedanatomy">Before talking about causes of pain to the top of the foot, lets review the anatomy.  The top of the foot consists of bones (talus, navicular, cuneiforms, cuboid, metatarsals), several small arteries, small nerves, and tendons.  So any pain generally is a problem with one or a combination of those anatomic structures.</p>
      <img src="../../../blog/images/dorsalfootanatomy.jpg" class="img-responsive">
      <h4 itemprop="name"> 1. Stress Fracture</h4>
      <p itemprop="cause">Stress fractures the the most common cause of top of foot pain.  Usually, these injuries start of as a mild discomfort which gradually progress and become worse.  Swelling will usually occur towards the end of the day or after prolonged activities, only to feel better in the morning.  Stress fracture are caused from repetitive  stress to the bones which results in microscopic injuries.  The body is unable to heal the injuries fast enough and an accumulation of micro fractures leads to increasing pain and swelling.</p>

      <p>Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis, also called medial calcific sclerosis, is a form of arteriosclerosis or vessel hardening, where calcium deposits form in the middle layer of the walls of medium sized vessels (the tunica media). It is often not clinical unless it is severe. This human medial calcification, Mönckeberg’s sclerosis, is common and occurs independently of atherosclerosis.</p>

        Got the bunion blues.  Don’t worry; you’re not alone.   Let me help shed some light on this matter.  

        <h4>What exactly is a bunion?</h4>
        <p>A bunion is a bump on the side of the foot. A bunion is NOT an extra piece of bone; is NOT an enlargement of bone; is NOT a bone spur and more importantly it is NOT a tumor but it represents progressive disorder caused by a splaying of 2 bones that are normally parallel.  It has been reported that there is a genetic component that plays a role in the development of a bunion along with shoe gear.</p>
