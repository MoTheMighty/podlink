      <p>There are dozens of different types of bunion surgery.  Many named after the doctor who first published the particular technique.  Scarf bunionectomy, however, is named after a wood working technique referring to a joint made by notching, grooving, or otherwise cutting the ends of two pieces and fastening them together so that they overlap and join firmly into one continuous piece.  It is this concept that drew me towards this performing this type of bunionectomy.</p>
      <p>I have performed many different types and bunion surgery over the years and found pluses and minuses in all of them.  One common theme was stability and returning the patient to...

     <h1>New treatment for chronic Achilles tendonitis and plantar fasciitis</h1>

              Over 10 million people in this the United States suffer from chronic  Achilles tendon or plantar fascial pain, in addition to pain, these conditions also limit range of motion and prevent people from living active lives. Common treatment options include rest, stretching and ice. Next, pain medication addresses the pain but not the source of the pain. Physical therapy modalities are ordered to help improve range of motion, flexibility and strength. Finally, an open surgical procedure can be performed to remove the damaged tissue. These procedures have good success, however, there are always risks associated with any invasive surgery.  Additionally, considerations must be given to the time missed from work while recovering from traditional treatments for tendon and fascial pain.</p>
              <img src="../../../blog/images/tenextxdog.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="TenexTx minimally invasive heel surgery">
              <p>The podiatrist of Alamo Family Foot & Ankle Care are among the first specially trained doctors in this area to offer an advanced treatment option for tendon and fascial injuries—called the Tenex Health TX System.   We are extremely pleased with the results we are seeing in our patients who have been treated with Tenex Health TX. They have reported experiencing tremendous pain relief and a quick recovery.  This new option will become the curative treatment that removes the source of tendon pain and allows the tendon to truly heal.</p>
              <h3>What causes tendon pain?</h3>
              <p>Tendon pain is caused by damage to the tendon by trauma from a hit, twist, or pull on the joint or by repetitive motion from overuse in work, exercise, or activity. In these situations, the tendon tissue breaks down. The damaged tissue causes intense pain, which dramatically affects people’s ability to function. 
              Tenex Health TX is an optimal solution for Achilles tendonosis and plantar fasciitis.  Many patients lead very active lifestyles and therefore suffer tendon injuries. Prior to Tenex Health TX, they either had to live and work 
              around the pain or take time off to recover. Tenex Health TX allows them to return to what they enjoy doing quickly. Patients can generally return to their normal daily activities, without the restrictions caused by pain from damaged tendon tissue, physical therapy, and lengthy recovery times.</p>
              <h3>What can I expect during the Tenex Health TX procedure?</h3>
              <p>Tenex Health TX—medically known as Percutaneous Tenotomy and Fasciotomy—is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the surgeon to remove the source of tendon pain quickly and safely. Tenex Health TX is performed at an outpatient surgery center, using a local anesthetic to numb the area.
              During a Tenex Health TX procedure, musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging is used to identify the location of the damaged tendon or fascia tissue. Once located, a small incision it made and a 1/16” probe delivers ultrasonic energy specifically designed to break up and remove damaged, scared tissue safely and quickly, allowing the tendon to heal and eliminating the pain. 
              The treatment itself takes less than 20 minutes, and most patients are able to return to their normal activities within two to six weeks.
              We are excited about being able to provide the most technologically advanced treatment option for tendon and fascial injuries here in San Antonio that truly benefits our patients. It is profoundly rewarding to see them really enjoying their lives—without pain. Tenex Health TX has made a world of difference for our patients.

 <h1>Eight tips for new runners</h1>
      <p class="lead">by <a href="../../doctors/perez.php">Dr. Richard Perez</a></p>
      <hr>
      <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on February 1, 2015 at 4:42 PM</p>



      <hr>
      

          <p>I have the good fortune of seeing many runners in my practice.  Typically, around marathon season, there will be a  steady stream of runners coming to see me with various injuries ranging from tendonitis to stress fractures.</p>  <p>Until recently, I could not directly relate to runners; I was not one of them.</p>
            <p>Cycling has been my passion for the last ten years.  In 2005 I weighed 50 lbs more than I do now - I needed to take action.  After watching the Tour de France that year, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an indoor bike.
            About three weeks of boredom led me to abandon the machine and soon it became a fixture for hanging clothes and various odds and ends.  I graduated to a true road bike and discovered my passion. Biking.
            Fast forward to the winter of 2014-15.  It has been cold and wet here in San Antonio.   I have an indoor trainer for my bike, but I decided that unlike years past, I would forgo the tedium of that activity.</p>
            <h3>Running.</h3>
            <img src="../../../blog/images/perezjog.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="Dr. Richard Perez">
            <p>Running was going to be my go to aerobic sport for this winter.  Mind you, I have never run before, but I was determined to not regain the 50 lbs that I had fought so hard to lose.</p>
            <p>Six weeks into the hobby, I must say I have a new appreciation for the various ailments I have treated for runners throughout the years.  My shins hurt, hips ache, forefoot burns, peroneal tendons pull and my Achilles tendons pulsate.
            But slowly, my body is becoming accustomed to the new movements.  The pains subside and the benefits realized.
            From my brief time running here are 8 things I’ve learned.</p>
            <ul>
            <img src="../../../blog/images/perezshoes.jpg" class="img-responsive center" alt="newton running shoes">
              <li>Get a good pair of running shoes from a reputable running store.  Ask the sales person to watch you run on their in store treadmill.  For me- the recommendation was an entry level <a href="http://www.newtonrunning.com/mens-aha-gateway-trainer">Newtons</a>.  So far so good.  I like the way the shoe feels.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nyrr.org/youth-and-schools/running-start/coaching-videos/high-school/form/form-101-running-posture">Good posture.</a>  Slouching is a killer on your back.  Focus on a straight back and deliberate strides.  Knees up.  </li>

              <li><a href="http://www.active.com/running/articles/the-importance-of-rest-for-runners">Rest.</a></li>
              <li>See previous.</li>
              <li>For me, I found that <a href="http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/run-walk/">running one mile followed by walking one minute</a> allows some of the lactic acid to clear my legs and makes the run more comfortable.</li>
              <li>Don’t over do it at first.  Remember to let your body rest.</li>
              <li>Vary you pace from run to run.</li>
              <li>Have fun.</li>

      <p>Dr. Comfort, a leading manufacturer of therapeutic footwear, has released the <a href="http://homecaremag.com/news/unique-study-reveals-clinical-impacts-therapeutic-footwear-people-type-2-diabetes">results of its recent study</a>, which examined the clinical impact of therapeutic footwear on diabetic complications, including foot ulcers and amputations, in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The retrospective claims database study reviewed patients during a three-year period and showed that the likelihood of foot ulcers and amputation in T2DM patients not wearing therapeutic footwear was higher than in patients who did wear therapeutic footwear.  The study revealed that foot ulceration decreased by 2 percent and 12 percent in years one and two respectively, while lower limb amputation decreased by 29 percent and 18 percent in years one and two respectively.</p>

Toenail fungus is a very common problem seen by podiatrist.  It is often ignored, starting out as a small discoloration on the tip of the nail.  But with time, that small area grows and grows.

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p itemprop="associatedanatomy">Before talking about causes of pain to the top of the foot, lets review the anatomy.  The top of the foot consists of bones (talus, navicular, cuneiforms, cuboid, metatarsals), several small arteries, small nerves, and tendons.  So any pain generally is a problem with one or a combination of those anatomic structures.</p>
      <img src="../../../blog/images/dorsalfootanatomy.jpg" class="img-responsive">
      <h4 itemprop="name"> 1. Stress Fracture</h4>
      <p itemprop="cause">Stress fractures the the most common cause of top of foot pain.  Usually, these injuries start of as a mild discomfort which gradually progress and become worse.  Swelling will usually occur towards the end of the day or after prolonged activities, only to feel better in the morning.  Stress fracture are caused from repetitive  stress to the bones which results in microscopic injuries.  The body is unable to heal the injuries fast enough and an accumulation of micro fractures leads to increasing pain and swelling.</p>

        Got the bunion blues.  Don’t worry; you’re not alone.   Let me help shed some light on this matter.  

        <h4>What exactly is a bunion?</h4>
        <p>A bunion is a bump on the side of the foot. A bunion is NOT an extra piece of bone; is NOT an enlargement of bone; is NOT a bone spur and more importantly it is NOT a tumor but it represents progressive disorder caused by a splaying of 2 bones that are normally parallel.  It has been reported that there is a genetic component that plays a role in the development of a bunion along with shoe gear.</p>
