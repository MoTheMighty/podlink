        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p itemprop="associatedanatomy">Before talking about causes of pain to the top of the foot, lets review the anatomy.  The top of the foot consists of bones (talus, navicular, cuneiforms, cuboid, metatarsals), several small arteries, small nerves, and tendons.  So any pain generally is a problem with one or a combination of those anatomic structures.</p>

      <h4 itemprop="name"> 1. Stress Fracture</h4>
      <p itemprop="cause">Stress fractures the the most common cause of top of foot pain.  Usually, these injuries start of as a mild discomfort which gradually progress and become worse.  Swelling will usually occur towards the end of the day or after prolonged activities, only to feel better in the morning.  Stress fracture are caused from repetitive  stress to the bones which results in microscopic injuries.  The body is unable to heal the injuries fast enough and an accumulation of micro fractures leads to increasing pain and swelling.</p>

      <p>It is not often that I see a Victorian era disease come through the office.  But that's exactly what occurred recently.  Rickets , also known as Osteomalacia  is a bone disease caused primarily by a lack of Vitamin D.</p>

      <p>Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis, also called medial calcific sclerosis, is a form of arteriosclerosis or vessel hardening, where calcium deposits form in the middle layer of the walls of medium sized vessels (the tunica media). It is often not clinical unless it is severe. This human medial calcification, Mönckeberg’s sclerosis, is common and occurs independently of atherosclerosis.</p>

        Got the bunion blues.  Don’t worry; you’re not alone.   Let me help shed some light on this matter.  

        <h4>What exactly is a bunion?</h4>
        <p>A bunion is a bump on the side of the foot. A bunion is NOT an extra piece of bone; is NOT an enlargement of bone; is NOT a bone spur and more importantly it is NOT a tumor but it represents progressive disorder caused by a splaying of 2 bones that are normally parallel.  It has been reported that there is a genetic component that plays a role in the development of a bunion along with shoe gear.</p>
