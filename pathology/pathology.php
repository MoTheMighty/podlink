              When you have diabetes, the circulation of blood to your feet is not as good as it should be. It is harder for the body to fight infections and heal itself. As a result, any infections and sores on your feet can become serious. Without treatment, severe infections can cause the flesh of your foot to die (gangrene).

This technology is especially useful for treating plantar fasciitis.

When excess bone has grown across a joint there is usually little or no motion in that joint.
