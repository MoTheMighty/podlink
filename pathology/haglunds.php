                  <p>Haglund’s deformity is a bony enlargement on the back of the heel that most often leads
                      to painful bursitis, which is an inflammation of the bursa (a fluid-filled sac between the
                      tendon and bone). In Haglund’s deformity, the soft tissue near the Achilles tendon
                      becomes irritated when the bony enlargement rubs against shoes.</p> <p>Haglund’s deformity is often called “pump bump” because the rigid backs of pump-style
                      shoes can create pressure that aggravates the enlargement when walking. In fact, the
                      deformity is most common in young women who wear pumps.</p>

                  <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Haglund’s deformity can occur in one or both feet. The signs and symptoms include:</p> <ul> <li>A noticeable bump on the back of heel.</li> <li> Pain in the area where the Achilles tendon attaches to the heel.</li> <li>Swelling in the back of the heel.</li> <li>Redness near the inflamed tissue.</li> </ul> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>To some extent, heredity plays a role in Haglund’s deformity. People can inherit a type
                  of foot structure that makes them prone to developing this condition.</p> <p>For example, high arches can contribute to Haglund’s deformity. The Achilles tendon
                  attaches to the back of the heel bone, and in a person with high arches, the heel bone is
                  tilted backward into the Achilles tendon. This causes the uppermost portion of the back
                  of the heel bone to rub against the tendon. Eventually, due to this constant irritation, a
                  bony protrusion develops and the bursa becomes inflamed. It is the inflamed bursa that
                  produces the redness and swelling associated with Haglund’s deformity.</p> <p>A tight Achilles tendon can also play a role in Haglund’s deformity, causing pain by
                  compressing the tender and inflamed bursa. In contrast, a tendon that is more flexible
                  results in less pressure against the painful bursa.</p> <p>Another possible contributor to Haglund’s deformity is a tendency to walk on the outside
                  of the heel. This tendency, which produces wear on the outer edge of the sole of the
                  shoe, causes the heel to rotate inward, resulting in a grinding of the heel bone against
                  the tendon. The tendon protects itself by forming a bursa, which eventually becomes
                  inflamed and tender.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Radiographs, ultrasound and MRI along with a physical signs and symptoms are utilized to diagnose the condition.</p>

                  <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Non-surgical treatment of Haglund’s deformity is aimed at reducing the inflammation of
                    the bursa. While these approaches can resolve the bursitis, they will not shrink the bony
                    protrusion. Non-surgical treatment can include medication, icing, stretching, lifts,
                    orthosis, physical therapy and extra corporeal <a title="shockwave treatment" href="/treatments-and-conditions/shockwave-treatment.aspx">shockwave treatment</a>.&nbsp;
                    If non-surgical treatment fails to provide adequate pain relief, surgery may be needed.</p> <p>A variety of surgical techniques can be utilized to restore function</p>
