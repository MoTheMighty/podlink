<h3>Dr. Strash:</h3> <p>To date one of the best Doctors that I have ever met - makes you fell like family, wish there were like him out there in the medical profession. I can't find the words to discribe the outstanding care that I've received fron Dr. Strash and his staff-he beats all.
Ralph H.</p> <h3>Dr Chaney:</h3> <p>[I liked] how the doctor listened, didn't seem rushed to get me out quickly. He took the time to sit down and seemed genuinely concerned, good eye contact and bedside manner. He offered the most thorough treatment. Did not just walk in and prescribe meds and leave. They had equipment on site to make accurate diagnosis and did not have to travel for x-rays and then back - which delays treatment.</p> <h3>Dear Doctor Strash:</h3> <p>You can not improve more than now. You are great and it is me that needs to work more with my feet and ankle. Thank you for everything.</p> <p>Happy Holidays with all my heart for being there whenever I have need you.</p> <h3>Dear Dr. Richard Perez:</h3> <p>I just wanted to express my thanks and appreciation for the wonderful treatment and care Dr. Perez showed to me following my recent Bunion surgery.</p> <p>I travel from the Rio Grand Valley to San Antonio for all my Podiatry needs because I heard from a relative that Dr. Perez is the best podiatrist. I have lived with bunion pain for many years and thanks to Dr. Richard Perez excellent medical practice I am pain free. I could not thank him enough he has changed my life, no one should have to learn to live with pain and he has taught me that.</p> <p>Dr. Perez demonstrated total commitment into caring for me when I was helpless in the days immediately following the operation and also gave me the support and encouragement I needed to take my first steps on the road to my recovery which meant so much to me.</p> <p>I’d also like to thank the staff at Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care who provided me with their expertise in the post-operative support. The staff members were professional and played such an important part in my treatment and recovery.</p> <p>Recently I have fractured my foot, without hesitation I called Dr. Perez office and they assisted me with advice on how to relive my pain until I was able to make the drive up to San Antonio. Dr. Perez office was able to see me the very next day and treated me the same day for my condition. While in his office for my foot fracture Dr. Perez was able to treat my husband for his Gout. This has been an ongoing medical problem with my husband that Dr. Perez has helped him with. Dr. Perez educated my husband on how to handle Gout and to eliminate future flare ups.</p> <p>Thanks to Dr. Perez, my husband and I are now able to enjoy our retirement and vacations, a long-held dream to be able to go and visit new places take long walks pain free. Without his help, this would not have been possible so you can imagine how grateful I am.</p> <p>Thank you Dr. Perez once again for all your care and support.</p> <p>Best regards,<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Anguiano</p> <h3>Dr. Strash,&nbsp;</h3> <p>You helped my fracture go from fractured to fabulous! I fractured my toe this July... I am a competitive Irish Dancer and cannot dance with a fracture! I went to Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care on Broadway, and was put in a boot for 6 weeks, the healing went awesome and I was out of the boot in no time! I still had pain when I danced and so Dr. Strash sent us to PT. The PT physicians were awesome, he picked the right people for me! We had a blast! I easily recovered and now am back dancing!But, just last week at dance class I had pain in my heel. I knew it was Sever's disease and after talking to Dr. Strash... he put me in a night time splint and in spenco heel lifts with sneakers. I don't feel any pain now and it's only been 6 days!! I need more shoes but can only wear ones that support my arch because I have a high arch. So Dr. Strash gave my mom a prescription for Chacos and Merrels so we have a tax deduction for a good, supportive pair of shoes! Dr. Strash is the reason I can still dance today and this December travel to D.C. for regionals which I would not be able to compete in without the Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care! Being a growing kid, I have lots of problems with my feet, but I now know exactly what to do if I have any pain... Call Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care!! You guys are lifesavers! Thank You sooooooooooooo much!!!-<br />

I would highly recommend him to anyone. For 13 years I have had diabetes and I have never known a doctor like him. He is the one who saved my feet. Other doctors have told me my feet cannot be saved, but Dr. Perez did not give up on me. He knows what he is doing, he is fast, but more importantly, he treats you like a person. I give thanks to God for putting him in my life and for helping so many people with foot problems.<br />

I have been a patient of his for over 7 years, and recommend him to my friends who need a doctor specializing in the foot and ankle.<br />

I’ve found Richard Perez, D.P.M., F.A.C.FA.S., and his staff at Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care have everything you would expect a good podiatry firm to provide. Dr. Perez is at the forefront in treatment procedures. Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care go beyond providing a professional service and also educate their clients concerning their condition.</p> <p>There is a feeling of security and comfort when you enter the office and are personally greeted by name. My doctor, Richard Perez, D.P.M., takes an interest in me and not just my feet.</p> <p>I would recommend Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care to anyone who needs a Podiatrist or aren’t completely satisfied where they are now. Alamo Family Foot and Ankle Care will provide you with professional service.<br />
- Jimmy C.</p> </div> <div style="clear: both; padding-top: 25px;"> <h3>Lindsey's Story</h3> <p>Dr. Perez has taken wonderful care of me for the past year while I have had such a hard time with my foot. His staff is excellent and has always shown me great kindness whenever I've called about a concern I might have, to make an appointment, or when I come into the office. Having foot surgery can be extremely nerve racking because a person depends on their feet to do so much. However, Dr. Perez has shown enormous amounts of care and concern for my well being, and for my mother's as well since she was my care taker until I could move around for the past year. There aren't many doctors of office staff out there who would go above and beyond like they have.<br />
- Lindsey C.</p> <div style="clear: both; padding-top: 25px;"> <h3>Bob's Story</h3> <p>I have had foot problems for 30 or so years and have tried several different San Antonio podiatrists. A friend recommended me to Alamo Foot Care and at the time Dr. Strash was the only Dr. there and I was very pleased with his care.</p> <p>After a year or so, I had a very bad foot infection and was going up my leg. Dr. Strash was not in, but Dr. Perez was a new Dr. at the time and I saw him. He recognized the problem and I had emergency surgery. I easily could have lost my foot, but thanks to Dr. Perez that did not happen. Since then Dr. Perez has become my permanent podiatrist. He has performed quite a few operations (5 or 6 give or take) to correct the many foot problems that I have. Since I seem to get foot infections easily, I see Dr. Perez every month or so.</p> <p>I will tell you this. Dr. Perez will listen and will spend time with you and will explain all options for your existing problem. He has a wonderful personality. He has even helped me with several other problems that were not foot related. For example, I had to have a total knee replacement and knowing how susceptible I am to infection Dr. Perez recommended me to a particular Spurs orthopedic surgeon. That orthopedic Dr. mentioned he never had a patient that had an infection because of his surgery. I was quite worried, but no infections. I could not have been happier.</p> <p>Also, if Dr. Perez is not available, I see Dr. Strash who was the reason I went to Alamo Foot Care in the first place.</p> <p>And I can’t say enough about their staff Mari and Aurora. They are the best.</p> <p> I will never go anywhere else for my foot problems. <br />

What we like and respect about Dr. Perez is his sincerity and wonderful sense of humor. He always explains, very throughly, the problems and steps needed to make the right diagnosis and has the right solution to correct the problem. He never rushes us to get out of the exam room until we are satisfied with all of the answers to the questions we may have.</p> <p>My husband has been a diabetic for almost thirty years. And, diabetes presents a lot of complications. Dr. Perez has cured my husband of ulcers, infections, plus he has had to amputate some of his toes on one foot.</p> <p>Before we consulted Dr. Perez, I researched many podiatrist. I needed a Dr. that would be up to date with all the concerns of a diabetic patient, as my husband. I wanted this Dr. also to be firm, but compassionate with my husband, AND Dr. Perez is all of the above!</p> <p>Dr. Perez is also my podiatrist. He removed bunions from both of my feet. I experienced very little pain after my surgery.</p> <p>We have recommend Dr. Perez to family members as well as many friends that have picked him up as their podiatrist.</p> <p>Thank you, Dr. Richard Perez for being our podiatrist!<br />
