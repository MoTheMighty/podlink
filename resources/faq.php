           <p>We are committed to providing you with the best care possible. In order to achieve this goal we are in need of your assistance and understanding of our financial policy in the following areas:<br /> <ul> <li>The patient is responsible for any copayments and any unmet deductible amount, due and payable at the time of the office visit. As a courtesy, the office will bill your insurance company, provided you furnish the office with a completed insurance claim form or insurance card. A patient without medical insurance will be required to pay in full at the time of service.</li> <li>Medicare Patients Since our office accepts Medicare assignment, we will bill Medicare for you. Patients who have Medicare only, are responsible for the co-insurance portion approved by Medicare. If you have a secondary insurance, we will also bill them for you. &nbsp;Medicare restrictions can be explained by our staff</li> <li>Workmen's Compensation must be pre-approved before the patient may receive services.</li> <li>We accept cash, checks, Visa, Mastercard and American Express.</li> </ul>
            While the filing of your insurance claim is a courtesy we extend to our patients, we must emphasize that as medical care providers, our relationship is with you the patient, not your insurance company. All charges are the responsibility of the patient from the date the services are rendered. We realize that from time to time temporary financial setbacks may affect timely payments on your account. If such problems do arise, we encourage you to contact our office for assistance in the management of your account.<br /> <br />
            Our Staff will gladly discuss your proposed treatment and answer any question relating to your insurance. However, not all services are a covered benefit in all contracts and you must realize that your insurance is a contract between you, your employer, and the insurance company.<br /> <br />
            If you have any questions about the above information or have uncertainty reqarding the insurance coverage, please do not hesitate to ask for assistance.</p> </ul>
